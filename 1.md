My name is Alla ALbadarin, I have completed my bachelor degree at Zarqa Private University and my master degree at Jordan University of Science and Technology.. During my master study, I have investigated the miscibility of a hydrocarbon binary mixtures as well as their structure using Molecular Dynamic simulation supervised by Prof. Abdalla Obeidat.
Working in two different universities gained me an extensive experience of doing experimental and theoretical research. In 2019 I was a research assistant at Jordan University, I was working on several projects with Prof.  Sami Mahmood:

•	Synthesis and Characterization BaM Hexaferrites Substituted with copper, Molybdenum, silver and rare earth elements.   
•	X-ray diffraction SEM and VSM Characterization using multiple programs  x`pert High score program, Proficient in origin program, Fulproff (Lebal fitting for sample) EDX.

I have also worked with Prof. Abdalla obeidat on the following projects:
•	Investigating the structural and transport properties of methanol, ethanol with each of heptane, hexane, and cyclohexane binary mixtures using (OPLSS AA) force field, which is an empirical all-atom force field that has been applied to a wide range of hydrocarbon molecules to obtain thermodynamic and transport properties of various systems.


•	We have estimated the diffusion coefficients, velocity autocorrelation functions (VACF), density profile, and radial distribution functions (RDF) for six different mixtures. Self- and Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficients, as well as the surface tension of methanol, ethanol, and their hydrocarbons binary mixture are determined using equilibrium molecular dynamics and the Green-Kubo formalism using GROMACS 2018.3.
