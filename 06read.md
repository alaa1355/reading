1. CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.


2. Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).


3. Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
4. CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.
