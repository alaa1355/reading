**Wht google learned from its quest to build the perfect team**

One of her favorite competitions asked teams to come up with a new business to replace a student-run snack store on Yale&#39;s campus. Rozovsky proposed a nap room and selling earplugs and eyeshades to make money. Someone else suggested filling the space with old video games. There were ideas about clothing swaps. Most of the proposals were impractical, but &#39;&#39;we all felt like we could say anything to each other,&#39;&#39; Rozovsky told me. &#39;&#39;No one worried that the rest of the team was judging them.&#39;&#39; Eventually, the team settled on a plan for a microÂ­gym with a handful of exercise classes and a few weight machines. They won the competition.

**P**** roject Aristotle&#39;s researchers**

began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked. Were the best teams made up of people with similar interests? Or did it matter more whether everyone was motivated by the same kinds of rewards? Based on those studies, the researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google: How often did teammates socialize outside the office? Did they have the same hobbies? Were their educational backgrounds similar? Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy? They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments&#39; goals. They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team&#39;s success.

Imagine you have been invinted to join of two groups

Team A is composed of people who are all exceptionally smart and successful

When you watch a video of this group working, you see professionals who wait until a topic arises in which they are expert, and then they speak at length, explaining what the group ought to do. When someone makes a side comment, the speaker stops, reminds everyone of the agenda and pushes the meeting back on track. This team is efficient. There is no idle chitchat or long debates. The meeting ends as scheduled and disbands so everyone can get back to their desks.
