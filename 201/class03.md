# **Working with HTML Lists**

HTML lists are used to present list of information in well formed and semantic way. There are three different types of list in HTML and each one has a specific purpose and meaning.

- **Unordered list**  — Used to create a list of related items, in no particular order.\&lt;ul\&gt;
- **Ordered list**  — Used to create a list of related items, in a specific order.\&lt;ol\&gt;

## [What is the CSS box model?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#what_is_the_css_box_model)

The full CSS box model applies to block boxes, inline boxes only use some of the behavior defined in the box model. The model defines how the different parts of a box — margin, border, padding, and content — work together to create a box that you can see on the page. To add some additional complexity, there is a standard and an alternate box model.

### [Parts of a box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#parts_of_a_box)

Making up a block box in CSS we have the:

- **Content box** : The area where your content is displayed, which can be sized using properties like [width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) and [height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height).
- **Padding box** : The padding sits around the content as white space; its size can be controlled using [padding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) and related properties.
- **Border box** : The border box wraps the content and any padding. Its size and style can be controlled using [border](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) and related properties.
- **Margin box** : The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding and border as whitespace between this box and other elements. Its size can be controlled using [margin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) and related properties

## Controlling the Flow

We have met variables and operators. We can define variables and manipulate them. But we don&#39;t want to individually change every variable by hand. If we have to sort a list of names, we don&#39;t want to be comparing every entry against every other entry in a slow and laborious fashion.

 One of the achievements of the computer is that it allows multiple operations to be performed very quickly. We can combine this with the power of mathematics to produce very impressive techniques for our code.
