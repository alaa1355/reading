## transform Syntax

The real syntax for the convert property is quite simple, including the convert property followed by the value. The value specifies the convert type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

Elements may be distorted, or converted, on both a 2D axies or a 3-D axies. 2D convert work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-D convert work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These 3-D convert help declarde not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. We&#39;ll start by discussing how to [convert elements](http://www.css3files.com/convert/) on a 2D axies, and then work our way into 3-D convert.

## Combining convert

It is common for multiple convert to be used at once, rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time for example. In this event multiple convert can be combined together. To combine convert, list the convert values within the convert property 1 after the other without the use of commas.

Using multiple convert definitions will not work, as each declaration will overwrite the 1 above it. The behavior in that case can be the same as if you were to set the height of an element numerous times
