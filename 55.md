the difference between an if and while statement

Well the if is a one time branching operation and the while loop is as the name implies a loop. Meaning an if statement gives you once the possibility to do something or not (or something else). Whereas a while loop does things as long as the condition is true.

Here in the simple exercises we break the loop after the first try but you can do it far more times

var i = 0;
while(i < 4){
i++;
console.log(i)
}
this would work like this:

set i to 0
check if i < 4
--> true so execute loop body
set i to i+1 (increase it by 1)
print i
check again if condtion is true i is 1 so still less than 4
--> true
set increase i by 1 to 2
print i
check condition again 
...
this goes on until i < 4 turns to be false, than you leave the loop and continue after the {}
If you know how many loops you want to do you could aswell use a for loop:

for(var i = 0; i < 4;i++){
    console.log(i);
}

which does pretty much the same the var i=0 is executed only once when the loop starts the second part i < 4 is the condition that is checked after every execution of the loop body and the i++ is the increment that is triggered after every loop. The you can write any for loop as a while loop and likewise. more interesting examples for while loops are userInputs and stuff like this:

var password = prompt("enter your password");

while(password != 12345){
     password = prompt("enter your password");
}

If the user enters a password that is not 12345 he is asked to enter it again and again and again till he enters the correct password. Here one could use a different kind of while loop aswell the do/while loop:

do{
password = prompt("enter your password");
}while(password!= 12345)
its more or less the same as the other while loop, the feature is, that the code after do is once executed without a condition and after this it behaves like a regular while loop: check conditon execute code in braces check condition executeâ€¦ aso, as you can see this saves one line as the password = prompt("enter your password"); would once be executed anyway.
